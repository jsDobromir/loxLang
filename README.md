This repo is my work through this great book https://craftinginterpreters.com/ - Crafting Interpreters from Bob Nystrom (the first part only) , I have added to the language couple of things like ternary statements - ? : ,break statements ,passing anonymous function as parameter to other function,getters in the class ,static methods and static variables in the class and static getters also. To run the Interpreter type :

	java -cp classes com.craftinginterpreters.Lox

This will open the Repl ,to run with a file type 
	
	java -cp classes com.craftinginterpreters.Lox simple.lox
	
Run the command from the top folder in the terminal.
