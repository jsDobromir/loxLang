This repo is my work through this great book https://craftinginterpreters.com/ - Crafting Interpreters from Bob Nystrom , I have added to the language couple of things like ternary statements - ? : ,break statements ,passing anonymous function as parameter to other function,getters in the class ,static methods and static variables in the class and static getters also. To run the Interpreter type : 
	java -cp classes com.craftinginterpreters.Lox - this will open the REPL ,to run with a file just add the file as argument like this - 
	java -cp classes com.craftinginterpreters.Lox simple.lox. 
Run the command from the top folder in the terminal.
